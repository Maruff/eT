**Purpose of GAAP, IAS, and IFRS**

**1. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP):**

   - **Standardization:** GAAP aims to provide a common set of accounting standards and procedures, ensuring consistency and comparability of financial statements across different organizations within a country.
   - **Reliability:** By adhering to GAAP, companies enhance the reliability and credibility of their financial reports, which are used by investors, regulators, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions.
   - **Transparency:** GAAP promotes transparency in financial reporting, allowing stakeholders to gain a clear understanding of a company's financial health and performance.
   - **Compliance:** GAAP ensures that companies comply with national regulations and legal requirements, minimizing discrepancies and potential fraud in financial reporting.
   
**2. International Accounting Standards (IAS):**

   - **Global Comparability:** IAS provides a set of internationally recognized accounting standards that facilitate comparability of financial statements across different countries, promoting global investment and trade.
   - **Harmonization:** IAS aims to harmonize diverse accounting practices worldwide, reducing discrepancies and improving the quality of financial reporting on a global scale.
   - **Transparency and Accuracy:** By following IAS, companies enhance the transparency, accuracy, and integrity of their financial statements, benefiting investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.
   - **Basis for IFRS:** IAS served as the foundation for the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), contributing to the evolution of a comprehensive global accounting framework.

**3. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):**

   - **Global Standardization:** IFRS aims to establish a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable, and globally accepted accounting standards. This facilitates the comparability of financial statements across international boundaries.
   - **Enhanced Transparency:** IFRS promotes transparency in financial reporting by requiring companies to provide comprehensive disclosures, enabling stakeholders to make better-informed decisions.
   - **Investor Confidence:** By ensuring consistency and comparability of financial reports, IFRS enhances investor confidence and promotes the efficient functioning of capital markets.
   - **Economic Growth:** Adoption of IFRS can stimulate economic growth by attracting foreign investment and fostering cross-border economic activities, as investors are more likely to invest in markets with transparent and comparable financial information.
   - **Reduction of Costs:** For multinational companies, adopting IFRS can reduce the costs associated with preparing multiple sets of financial statements under different national standards.
   - **Regulatory Alignment:** IFRS aims to align accounting standards with global best practices, ensuring that financial statements reflect the economic reality of transactions and events.

**Summary:**

- **GAAP:** Primarily used in the US, ensures consistency, reliability, and compliance within the country, enhancing transparency and investor confidence.
- **IAS:** Provides a foundation for global comparability and harmonization of accounting standards, forming the basis for IFRS.
- **IFRS:** Aims for global standardization of accounting practices, promoting transparency, investor confidence, economic growth, and reduced compliance costs for multinational entities.
