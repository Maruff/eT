No, it is not necessary to adopt IAS (International Accounting Standards) in the presence of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Here are the key reasons why:

### **Evolution from IAS to IFRS:**
- **Historical Context:** IAS were the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) before the establishment of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in 2001. Since then, the IASB has been responsible for developing new standards, known as IFRS.
- **Transition:** Over time, many IAS have been replaced or amended by IFRS. IFRS represents the latest standards and are designed to improve and update the older IAS.

### **Current Practice:**
- **IFRS Incorporation:** IFRS includes both the original IAS that have not been replaced or amended and the new IFRS issued by the IASB. When a standard is revised or a new standard is issued, it supersedes the previous IAS if applicable.
- **Full Set of Standards:** By adopting IFRS, entities inherently comply with the relevant IAS still in effect, as IFRS encompasses all current applicable standards, including unrevised IAS.

### **Regulatory Alignment:**
- **Global Adoption:** Many countries have adopted IFRS as their accounting standard, making it the global benchmark for financial reporting. Adoption of IFRS ensures compliance with international norms and practices, fostering global comparability and transparency.
- **Avoiding Redundancy:** Adopting IAS independently of IFRS can create redundancy and confusion, as IFRS already includes the applicable IAS. This dual adoption is unnecessary and inefficient.

### **Consistency and Clarity:**
- **Unified Framework:** IFRS provides a single, cohesive framework for financial reporting, reducing complexity and ensuring clarity. Adopting both IAS and IFRS separately can create inconsistency and undermine the objective of having a unified set of standards.
- **Up-to-date Standards:** IFRS represents the most current and relevant standards. Sole reliance on IAS without considering the updates and improvements made by IFRS would result in using outdated accounting practices.

### **Conclusion:**
In summary, adopting IFRS is sufficient and preferable as it encompasses all relevant IAS that have not been superseded. IFRS ensures that entities comply with the most up-to-date international accounting standards, fostering consistency, transparency, and global comparability in financial reporting. There is no need to adopt IAS separately in the presence of IFRS.
