# Evolution of Tamil Scripts

The Tamil script has a long and rich history that traces back several centuries. Here is a detailed look at the evolution of Tamil alphabets from ancient times to the modern script used today.

## Ancient Tamil Script (Tamizhi)

- **Early Inscriptions:** The earliest form of the Tamil script is known as Tamizhi or Tamil-Brahmi. It dates back to around the 3rd century BCE. Inscriptions from this period are found in caves and on pottery.
- **Characteristics:** Tamizhi was derived from the Brahmi script and was mainly used for writing inscriptions. The characters were more angular and geometric compared to modern Tamil.

## Transition to Vatteluttu

- **Vatteluttu Script:** Around the 5th century CE, the Tamil script began to evolve into a more rounded form known as Vatteluttu (meaning "round script"). This script was prominent in inscriptions and manuscripts from the Pallava and early Chola periods.
- **Characteristics:** Vatteluttu featured more rounded and flowing characters, making it easier to carve on stones and write on palm leaves.

## Chola Period and Grantha Influence

- **Grantha Script:** During the later Chola period (9th to 13th centuries), the Tamil script was influenced by the Grantha script, which was used to write Sanskrit. This influence introduced several new characters and diacritics to Tamil.
- **Characteristics:** The integration of Grantha elements helped to distinguish Tamil from other Dravidian scripts and added more complexity to the writing system.

## Medieval to Early Modern Period

- **Evolution of Form:** The Tamil script continued to evolve, with gradual changes in the shape and form of the letters. By the 15th century, the script began to resemble its modern form.
- **Printing Influence:** The advent of printing technology in the 16th and 17th centuries brought standardization to the Tamil script. Early Tamil printed books and manuscripts helped to solidify the shapes of the letters.

## Modern Tamil Script

- **Standardization:** The modern Tamil script was standardized in the 19th century, with the efforts of scholars and the influence of British colonial administration. The shapes of the letters were formalized, and a uniform orthography was established.
- **Characteristics:** The modern Tamil script consists of 12 vowels (uyir), 18 consonants (mei), and one special character (ayutha ezhuthu). Additionally, there are compound letters formed by combining vowels and consonants.

## Summary of Tamil Script Evolution

- **Tamizhi (Tamil-Brahmi):** Angular and geometric, used from the 3rd century BCE.
- **Vatteluttu:** Rounded script, prominent from the 5th century CE.
- **Grantha Influence:** Added complexity and new characters during the Chola period.
- **Medieval Period:** Gradual evolution towards the modern form.
- **Modern Standardization:** Formalized in the 19th century with the influence of printing technology.

## Conclusion

The Tamil script has undergone significant changes over the centuries, evolving from ancient Tamizhi to the modern script used today. This evolution reflects the dynamic history of the Tamil language and its adaptation to cultural and technological advancements. The modern Tamil script is a blend of historical influences and standardizations, making it one of the oldest continuously used scripts in the world.
