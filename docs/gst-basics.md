# Indian GST Calculation Formulas for Accounting Application Development

## 1. GST Basics

### Types of GST
- **CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax):** Levied by the Central Government on intra-state supplies of goods and services.
- **SGST (State Goods and Services Tax):** Levied by the State Government on intra-state supplies of goods and services.
- **IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax):** Levied by the Central Government on inter-state supplies of goods and services.

## 2. GST Calculation Formulas

### Total GST Calculation
For intra-state supplies:
```
Total GST = CGST + SGST
```

For inter-state supplies:
```
Total GST = IGST
```

### GST Amount Calculation
For intra-state supply:
```
CGST Amount = (Taxable Value * CGST Rate) / 100
SGST Amount = (Taxable Value * SGST Rate) / 100
```

For inter-state supply:
```
IGST Amount = (Taxable Value * IGST Rate) / 100
```

### Invoice Total Calculation
For intra-state supply:
```
Invoice Total = Taxable Value + CGST Amount + SGST Amount
```

For inter-state supply:
```
Invoice Total = Taxable Value + IGST Amount
```

## 3. Example Calculations

### Intra-state Supply Example
- **Taxable Value:** ₹10,000
- **CGST Rate:** 9%
- **SGST Rate:** 9%

```
CGST Amount = (10,000 * 9) / 100 = ₹900
SGST Amount = (10,000 * 9) / 100 = ₹900
Total GST = ₹900 + ₹900 = ₹1,800
Invoice Total = ₹10,000 + ₹900 + ₹900 = ₹11,800
```

### Inter-state Supply Example
- **Taxable Value:** ₹10,000
- **IGST Rate:** 18%

```
IGST Amount = (10,000 * 18) / 100 = ₹1,800
Invoice Total = ₹10,000 + ₹1,800 = ₹11,800
```

## 4. Input Tax Credit (ITC)

Businesses can claim ITC for the GST paid on purchases:
```
Net GST Payable = Output GST - Input GST
```

## 5. Additional Considerations

### GST Rates
GST rates vary by product/service. Ensure your application allows users to input or select the applicable GST rate.

### Exemptions and Reverse Charge
Some goods and services are exempt from GST or subject to reverse charge. Your application should handle these scenarios.

### GST Returns
Businesses need to file regular GST returns. Your application should track GST collected and paid to facilitate return filing.

## Summary

By incorporating these formulas and considerations, your accounting application can accurately calculate GST for both intra-state and inter-state transactions, manage ITC, and ensure compliance with Indian GST regulations.
