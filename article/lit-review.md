### **1. Introduction** (Draft)

#### **1.1 Background and Motivation**
The Indian financial sector, encompassing banking, insurance, and various FinTech services, has experienced rapid growth and transformation in recent years. With the proliferation of digital technologies and the increasing complexity of financial operations, there is a pressing need for specialized tools that can streamline processes, enhance security, and improve overall efficiency. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have emerged as a critical technological innovation in this regard, offering tailored solutions for specific industries and applications.

In the global context, DSLs have been successfully implemented in various financial systems, enabling more efficient and accurate financial operations. However, the Indian financial sector presents unique challenges that are not fully addressed by existing DSLs. These challenges include diverse linguistic and cultural considerations, regulatory complexities, and the need for financial inclusion across a vast and varied population. A DSL designed specifically for the Indian context could address these challenges by providing a more localized and efficient solution.

#### **1.2 Problem Statement**
Despite the advancements in financial technology and the development of DSLs for various financial applications, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive DSL tailored to the needs of the Indian financial sector. Existing DSLs and frameworks often fall short in addressing the unique requirements of Indian banking, insurance, and FinTech services. The lack of a specialized tool that can cater to the linguistic diversity and regulatory complexities of India poses a significant barrier to further advancements in this sector.

This gap in the current technological landscape highlights the need for a dedicated Indian DSL, such as eTamil, which could significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of financial operations in India. By developing a DSL that is specifically designed for Indian accounts and FinTech systems, there is an opportunity to overcome the challenges posed by existing solutions and to create a more robust and adaptable financial ecosystem in India.

#### **1.3 Objectives of the Survey**
